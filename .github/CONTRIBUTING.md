# Contributing to Gally

First, thank you for contributing, you're awesome!

To have your code integrated in the Gally project, there are some standards to apply, but don't be afraid, they are easy to master !

## Reporting Bugs

If you happen to find a bug, we kindly request you to report it. 

Then, if it appears that it's a real bug, you may report it using Github by following these 3 points:

  * Check if the bug is not already reported!
  * A clear title to resume the issue
  * A description of the workflow needed to reproduce the bug,

> _NOTE:_ Donâ€™t hesitate to give as much information as you can (OS, PHP version extensions...)

## Pull Requests

### Writing a Pull Request

You should base your changes on the `master` branch.

### Matching Coding Standards

The Gally project has it's own coding standards, inspired from the [Symfony coding standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html).
But don't worry, you can fix CS issues automatically using the [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) tool:

```bash
php-cs-fixer.phar fix
```

And then, add fixed file to your commit before push.
Be sure to add only **your modified files**. If another files are fixed by cs tools, just revert it before commit.

### Sending a Pull Request

When you send a PR, just make sure that:

* You add valid test cases.
* Tests are green.
* You make the PR on the same branch you based your changes on. If you see commits
  that you did not make in your PR, you're doing it wrong.
* Squash your commits into one commit. (see the next chapter)

Fill in the following header from the pull request template:

```markdown
| Q             | A
| ------------- | ---
| Bug fix?      | yes/no
| New feature?  | yes/no
| BC breaks?    | no
| Deprecations? | no
| Tests pass?   | yes
| Fixed tickets | #1234, #5678
| License       | MIT
```

## Squash your Commits

If you have 3 commits. So start with:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

An editor will be opened with your 3 commits, all prefixed by `pick`.

Replace all `pick` prefixes by `fixup` (or `f`) **except the first commit** of the list.

Save and quit the editor.

After that, all your commits where squashed into the first one and the commit message of the first commit.

If you would like to rename your commit message type:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

Now force push to update your PR:

```bash
git push --force
```
